# Chemical-Challenge-By-IIT-Kharagpur
Basically this is a challenge given by IIT Kharagpur in which we have to predict Relative Humidity

In this challenge dataset is already given which contains various features like Time, Date, Temperature, Nitrogen Level, etc...

Bacically I used three algorithms Decion Tree, Random Forest and Logistic Regression. From which Decion Tree gives best accuracy.

## Data Collection
Data is provided by them we have to download it from the link

## Data cleaning and Feature selection
Data is already cleaned only some features that we want to drop by using correlation matrix.

## Model training
Model is trained using three algorithms but Decion Tree gives best accuracy
